# Linear-Algebra-Project
I have done this project as a final project for the course "Linear Algebra" during spring 2023 semester. This project contains two jupyter notebooks with following subjects:

  1. Spectrul clustering of a graph using numpy, sklearn and matplotlib packages.
  2. Image compression and denoising with fft-2 and SVD methods.
